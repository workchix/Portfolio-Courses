# Portfolio-Courses
WELCOME TO COURSES<BR>
In 2016 I decided to offer a free email course on Security. Technology at the time suddenly took a giant leap, and people were feeling a little overwhelmed.
<br><br>
The course consisted of nine chapters/sections:
<br> 
* Security introduction<br>
* Passwords<br>
* Email <br>
* PGP <br>
* Browsers <br>
* Mobile <br>
* Free WiFi <br>
* VPN <br>
* Encryption
